# Interpreting dosage compensation through complex trait genome-wide associations

Provided below are resources and scripts used in "Interpreting dosage compensation through complex trait genome-wide associations".

## Resources

+ GWAS summary statistics with UK Biobank and FinnGen R10 data from Zenodo.
+ Extend reference panel for [GENESIS](https://github.com/yandorazhang/GENESIS) analysis that included the X chromosome.

## Analyses

### Estimation of SNP-heritability and effect size distribution in chrX and autosomes

### LD blocks in chrX and autosomes

### XCI scenarios analysis with sex-specific heritabilities

### Four-component sex bias mixture model of genome-wide variants
